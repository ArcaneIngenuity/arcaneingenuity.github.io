After a productive weekend and day today (Monday) [arc](https://github.com/ArcaneIngenuity/arc), arc framework is in a more easily configurable state, and orb's input system has seen some nice improvements as well making my impending work on the UI simpler.

This progress allows me to continue full speed ahead with the War & Adventure rebuild - as I recently gutted a lot of code in order to start from a clean slate.

Though I promised screenshots of an older build over this weekend, I've decided to rather focus on rebuilding quickly and so will post shots of interest as I go, and a video once things have become nicely interactive again. As such, all will be shown in good time.

A look ahead
------------

Short-term goals are to get War & Adventure's

 * UI panels up and running / interactive;
 * text rendering reinstated, and implement a basic monospaced system for display thereof;
 * basic lobby up, where player(s) will configure world / game settings.

Beyond that, I'll be rewriting the data model for terrain while re-working rendering thereof, re-instating the first person view. After that I hope  to spend some time focusing heavily on the environment to give you all something nice to look at.
