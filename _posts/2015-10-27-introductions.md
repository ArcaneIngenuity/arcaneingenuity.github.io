Development of the game **War & Adventure (WA)** is documented here.

The game is to be a first/third person hybrid FPS/RTS/RPG (all that), with a focus on exploration and ever-changing worlds, aside from the obligatory action and explosions.

Visually, WA takes a fairly abstract approach, so if you enjoyed Damocles, Darwinia, Elite, Carrier Command, Journey, Proteus, World of Goo, Worms and the like, you will probably enjoy what is in store. I grew up in the 80's when games were by necessity more abstract than they are now, which can inspire the imagination, so I aim for simple, soothing visuals and unobtrusive soundtracks, and meaningful gaming experiences where possible. Siege, exploration, amazing vistas, building, and dynamic adventures are on the cards, as well as multiplayer (later on).
