I'm [Arcane Engineer](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/5473/arcane-engineer), in top 0.02% of users on gamedev SE and active on [github](https://github.com/ArcaneEngineer).

[Arcane Ingenuity](http://arcaneingenuity.com/) is my operation. In the past the company has quietly contracted its services out in terms of games and real-time apps consultancy and development, both web and native, for the UK market. It is now forming its own identity.

### More Information

I'm currently living in the quiet city of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, but I could be off to other lands again at a moments notice... I've lived / worked on four already. Most of all, I like peace, quiet, natural surroundings and immersion in either building or playing games.
